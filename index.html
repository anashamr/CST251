		<p>I'm Ana Shamroukh a student at CSUMB currently working towards a Communication Design Major with a concentration in Web Design.</p>

		<p>I'm really excited to be learning about HTML in order to create our own website from the ground up which I think is going to be a lot of fun.</p>

		<p>What I hope to do with my new found web development knowledge is to build upon it and learn as much as I can for my major.</p>
