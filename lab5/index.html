	<h1>Lab 4: File Transfer</h1>

	<h2>Big Idea</h2>
		<p>The big idea for this lab is to work with your partner in order to create a webpage that includes images and links to other pages.</p>

	<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>This lab had fimilar elements from previous labs and some new elements from the lectures. The new challenge was adding links to other websites but specifically linking an image to another site. It took a bit of trial and error. </p>

	<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>The results of this lab were successful as I Had all the images show up on the page and all the links worked correctly.</p>
